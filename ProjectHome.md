# Introduction #
Library allows you to create LED objects in your Arduino code that you can easily control (fade) using a single command. The fades do not interrupt the rest of your code.

You can create single LEDs, Warm/Cool white LEDs and RGB LEDs, and control them using their human-friendly parameters (Intensity, Color Temperature, Hue, Saturation).

# Code and Download #
You can view the [source code of the library](http://code.google.com/p/led-library/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2F) or [download the library](http://code.google.com/p/led-library/downloads/list).
